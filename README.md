# Palindrome Checker Solution from freeCodeCamp

This project is a simple web application that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter case.

## Features

- User can input a string into a text field
- When the "Check" button is clicked, the application analyzes the input string
- The result (whether the input is a palindrome or not) is displayed on the page
- The input string is preprocessed to remove non-alphanumeric characters, convert to lowercase, and remove spaces
- Various test cases are implemented to ensure the application works correctly for different input scenarios

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Test Cases

The application has been tested with various input strings, including:

- Empty strings
- Single-character strings
- Strings with special characters, punctuation marks, and spaces
- Strings with mixed cases
- Palindromes and non-palindromes
